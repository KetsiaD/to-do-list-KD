# Track Record List

A first attempt at a Flutter App for my Mobile Dev Class.

## Purpose

This app is meant to be a place for any athlete that is passionate about track and field to be able to track their personal records in an easy way. It is as simple as clicking a button and entering in the event, the mark in said event, and the meet and year the record was achieved. The event then appears on the page. There is also a side bar that allows for you to have different sections if you want to seperate them by type of events such as distance, sprints, or field.
