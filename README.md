# Better Get it Done App

## What the App Does

Better Get it Done App is a simple to do list mobile app that should help the user to keep track of the tasks they are supposed to do. It is easy to read and very user friendly.

## How it Works

When you first open the app, you will see a greyish button in the bottom right corner, right above the navigation bar, that says "Add". When you click on that, you will see a small window that allows you to add an activity that you want to add to your to do list. After typing it in, you hit okay the "OK" button and it adds your activity to the activity list.

## Structural Details

This app uses a listview widget to display activities in a scrollable list. So, far, it has one screen but I'm currently working on it to make significant improvements and make it more usable.

## Target Audience for the App

This app can be used by anyone, from office workers who want to keep track of their meetings and otheer activities to students who want to keep track of how far they are on their assignments. It has a useful feature for crossing out and/or deleting items that you finished working on. This helps the user to remain organized.

Here are some screenshots of screens in my app.

First we have the home screen, then the add song textfield, then a list of our songs which are favorited
